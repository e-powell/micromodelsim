# TO DO
- A function for visualizing an ODF expansion
- Improved tutorial
- Comprehensive testing (using ~1e4 realistic ODFs)
- Share with the team, Paul, and Joel

## Issues to be taclked by the team
- Quality control by testing to find and fix typos and bugs
- Write more example notebooks highlighting use cases
- Optimize performance by improving algorithms (sampling etc)
- Optimize performance by using faster packages (JAX)
- ODF generation (random and non-random)
- Realistic ODF fetching
